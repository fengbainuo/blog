## Joplin + Hugo

![Title picture](../../images/joplin_hugo_title.png)

As the title suggests, this blog post is a test to see how to optimize my workflow of using Joplin the write my blog posts. Joplin is a powerful and free (as in freedom) note taking app (I recommend checking out their website at [joplinapp.org](https://joplinapp.org/)). Joplin uses the lightweight and popular markup language [Markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown).

 Coincidentally, Hugo uses the same language to format the posts. Well, maybe it's not a coincidence that I want to write my blog posts in Joplin after all.
